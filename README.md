⚔️ Hero's Quest ⚔️
==================

Hero's Quest is a Web application game where the user controls a player through various stages and several enemies to reach the goal of achieving `10,000 🪙`. To reach this goal the user will have to slay several monsters and spend that precious gold to upgrade their health and attack power.

## The Setup

A lot of the HTML and CSS for this project has already been completed. There are also several helper functions that can be called at appropriate times to facilitate the tricky parts of this application. By the end of this project students will have acquired a deeper understanding of building web applications and specifically event driven programming. 

## Getting Started

There are 3 main `js` files that students are expected to complete. Students will also have to update portions of the `index.html` document to help wire up buttons and gain hooks needed for various changes. Follow along with this readme as opposed to jumping around. 

To get started take a look at the `screen-manager.js` and we will wire up the buttons needed to show and hide the various screens.
